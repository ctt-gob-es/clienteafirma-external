/**
 * This is a utility class implementing the 3 most common Perl5 operations
 * involving regular expressions:
 * <ul>
 * <li> [m]/pattern/[i][m][s][x],
 * <li> s/pattern/replacement/[g][i][m][o][s][x],
 * <li> and split().
 * </ul>
 * As with Perl, any non-alphanumeric character can be used in lieu of
 * the slashes.
 *  <p>
 * The objective of the class is to minimize the amount of code a Java
 * programmer using Jakarta-ORO
 * has to write to achieve the same results as Perl by
 * transparently handling regular expression compilation, caching, and
 * matching.  A second objective is to use the same Perl pattern matching
 * syntax to ease the task of Perl programmers transitioning to Java
 * (this also reduces the number of parameters to a method).
 * All the state affecting methods are synchronized to avoid
 * the maintenance of explicit locks in multithreaded programs.  This
 * philosophy differs from the
 * {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex} package, where
 * you are expected to either maintain explicit locks, or more preferably
 * create separate compiler and matcher instances for each thread.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, first create an instance using the default constructor
 * or initialize the instance with a PatternCache of your choosing using
 * the alternate constructor.  The default cache used by Perl5Util is a
 * PatternCacheLRU of capacity GenericPatternCache.DEFAULT_CAPACITY.  You may
 * want to create a cache with a different capacity, a different
 * cache replacement policy, or even devise your own PatternCache
 * implementation.  The PatternCacheLRU is probably the best general purpose
 * pattern cache, but your specific application may be better served by
 * a different cache replacement policy.  You should remember that you can
 * front-load a cache with all the patterns you will be using before
 * initializing a Perl5Util instance, or you can just let Perl5Util
 * fill the cache as you use it.
 * <p>
 * You might use the class as follows:
 * <pre>
 * Perl5Util util = new Perl5Util();
 * String line;
 * DataInputStream input;
 * PrintStream output;
 *
 * // Initialization of input and output omitted
 * while((line = input.readLine()) != null) {
 *     // First find the line with the string we want to substitute because
 *     // it is cheaper than blindly substituting each line.
 *     if(util.match("/HREF=\"description1.html\"/")) {
 *        line = util.substitute("s/description1\\.html/about1.html/", line);
 *     }
 *    output.println(line);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A couple of things to remember when using this class are that the
 * {@link #match match()} methods have the same meaning as
 * {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex.Perl5Matcher#contains
 *  Perl5Matcher.contains()}
 * and <code>=~ m/pattern/</code> in Perl.  The methods are named match
 * to more closely associate them with Perl and to differentiate them
 * from {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex.Perl5Matcher#matches
 * Perl5Matcher.matches()}.
 * A further thing to keep in mind is that the
 * {@link MalformedPerl5PatternException} class is derived from
 * RuntimeException which means you DON'T have to catch it.  The reasoning
 * behind this is that you will detect your regular expression mistakes
 * as you write and debug your program when a MalformedPerl5PatternException
 * is thrown during a test run.  However, we STRONGLY recommend that you
 * ALWAYS catch MalformedPerl5PatternException whenever you deal with a
 * DYNAMICALLY created pattern.  Relying on a fatal
 * MalformedPerl5PatternException being thrown to detect errors while
 * debugging is only useful for dealing with static patterns, that is, actual
 * pregenerated strings present in your program.  Patterns created from user
 * input or some other dynamic method CANNOT be relied upon to be correct
 * and MUST be handled by catching MalformedPerl5PatternException for your
 * programs to be robust.
 * <p>
 * Finally, as a convenience Perl5Util implements
 * the {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex.MatchResult MatchResult} interface.
 * The methods are merely wrappers which call the corresponding method of
 * the last {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex.MatchResult MatchResult}
 * found (which can be accessed with {@link #getMatch()}) by a match or
 * substitution (or even a split, but this isn't particularly useful).
 * At the moment, the
 * {@link org.apache.oro.text.regex.MatchResult MatchResult} returned
 * by {@link #getMatch()} is not stored in a thread-local variable.  Therefore
 * concurrent calls to {@link #getMatch()} will produce unpredictable
 * results.  So if your concurrent program requires the match results,
 * you must protect the matching and the result retrieval in a critical
 * section.  If you do not need match results, you don't need to do anything
 * special.  If you feel the J2SE implementation of {@link #getMatch()}
 * should use a thread-local variable and obviate the need for a critical
 * section, please express your views on the oro-dev mailing list.
